# About

Hi, I'm Phillip Raffns√∏e.

I'm a 24-year-old guy who has been designing and developing websites for around 10 years.

Besides web, I also dabble in other development areas, from embeded systems programming to functional raytracers.

I'm a multimedia designer of the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology (2014), currently studying for a bachelor in software development at the IT University of Copenhagen.
